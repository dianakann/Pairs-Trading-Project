# Pairs Trading Project
This project is a Python-based stock data analysis and visualization tool that allows users to download historical stock price data for Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance and plot it using Matplotlib. The tool uses the yfinance library to retrieve the data and the matplotlib library to generate the plots.

The project is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to beginners in Python programming. Users can easily modify the code to download and plot data for other stocks or change the time period for which the data is retrieved. The code is well-commented and structured, making it easy for users to understand and modify.

This project is useful for anyone who wants to analyze and visualize stock price data for MSFT and AAPL or any other publicly traded companies. The tool can be used to identify trends, compare the performance of different stocks, and make informed investment decisions.

Overall, this project is a great way to learn how to use Python libraries for data analysis and visualization and to gain practical experience in retrieving and manipulating financial data.
